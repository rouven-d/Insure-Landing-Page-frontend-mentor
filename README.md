## Overview
Rebuilt the design based on the jpgs provided by Frontend Mentor, did not pay for Pro so no figma files were available.
This is a rough representation of the Frontend Mentor design, see link above or the design folder for the original version.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
Built out the website section by section mainly using pure HTML and CSS along with Bootstrap. Used JS and jquery for switching the title image to the top in mobile view.
There are still a few minor adjustments to be made, code refactoring still outstanding as well. 

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JS
- jquery
